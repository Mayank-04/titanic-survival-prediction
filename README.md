# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using various classification algorithms. Built using Python, scikit-learn, and visualized with Matplotlib.  

## 📌 Problem Statement

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, gender, passenger class, etc.

Dataset: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

---

## 📊 Features Used

- `Pclass` – Ticket class
- `Sex` – Gender
- `Age` – Age in years
- `SibSp` – # of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch` – # of parents/children aboard
- `Fare` – Passenger fare
- `Embarked` – Port of Embarkation

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped irrelevant features (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

Evaluated and compared 10 ML classifiers with cross-validation:

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear SVM
- RBF SVM
- Gaussian Process
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (MLP)
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes
- QDA
